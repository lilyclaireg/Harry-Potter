# Hogwarts: The Next Generation
We were assigned a project to create a role-playing game for my 'Introduction to Programming in Python' (CPSC1050) course here at Clemson University in the Spring 2024. In this game I created, you are a new Hogwarts student (Harry Potter's child) where you will get sorted into your house, learn spells, and help save Hagrid by battling a troll!
